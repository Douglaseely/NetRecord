The ultimate goal of NetRecord is to create a way to record and replay http request, 
while letting the user fully control what part of the request is used to match to get any saved request responses
There are 2 main focuses for the configurability of this project are:

1) User control over the unique identifier for the requests sent, so they can decide what will be used to match a request sent to a request response.
This will ideally be configurable during runtime so that within a single service lifetime there can be multiple requests pulled or saved in different ways,
though currently I'm not sure what configuration can both be edited after setup and passed through the generic HTTP Client calls that will be being used.

2) User control over where specifically recordings are saved. Again the goal will be for the user to be able to adjust these values during runtime, 
allowing saving to be changed between multiple requests of the same scoped service. Same issue arises here however, 
where I don't know how to pass the configuration through.

Version v1.0.0 Requirements:
Record and Replay requests
Unique Identifier and save strategy configurable during service setup

Stretch Goals:
Add a way to change the inside of the DI container after the scope has been made: 
The default IServiceProvider is an immutable DI container, so I CANNOT make changes after setup using it, in order to add 
the post setup runtime changing abilities that I want, it will require building my own implementation of the service provider.
This side of this library will come with v2, as I don't have the time resources to build that in depth of a user interface right now, and its
not explicitly needed yet.
